The PC Light system is composed of three main controls. Two toggle on-off switches and a potentiometer. The first toggle switch is a digital on-off switch that controls whether the led lights inside the pc are on or off. the second toggle switch is used to switch between modes. The first mode is a static colour (a colour with no movement). The second mode is a dynamic colour array displayed at various speeds (many colours cycling in a pattern). Within both modes, the potentiometer controls a certain aspect of the system. If the lights are static the potentiometer controls the colour which is displayed. If the lights are dynamic the potentiometer controls the speed at which the lights cycle. The lights are powered by an external 5V power supply, and the Arduino is plugged into the computer through a USB slot. This allows the lights to stay on even if the computer is shutdown, which gives full control over the lights to the user at any time.

Challenges:

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to code the dynamic colour pattern (moving colours). This is the first project where I used math to solve a problem. Other smaller problems included fitting everything into the PC nicely and also switch placement. Coding in different functions for different switches depending on the position of others was also tough.

Lessons:

Mathematics came in hand and really gave me a great example of the real-life application of mathematical equations. Working with this much hardware and applying it to a pre-existing system was also a great learning opportunity.

Possible Improvements:

Getting the colour white could have been hardcoded in but would have made the dynamic pattern weird. I wish I could think of a creative way to code in the colour white into the dynamic pattern smoothly.
